The fan would collide with the [z_idler_rear_(lowered)_x1_rev3.stl](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3/blob/main/Release_1_2/STLs/3Z_Drive_Components/for_long_hotends/%5Ba%5D_z_idler_rear_(lowered)_x1_rev3.stl) still if at max Y and to avoid any accidents in the future I added a 1mm shim to fit of the same shape as the part.
